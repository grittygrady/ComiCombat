## 🚀 [Live Site](https://comicombat.netlify.app/)

A site designed to finally put to rest the many friendship ruining superhero related arguments we all face every day.

## 💡 Motivation

This began as an afternoon experiment; I found the Superhero API and thought spinnning up a quick superhero SPA would be a quick, fun project. Oh how wrong I was - not about it being fun, but certainly about "quick". My work on ComiCombat ended up teaching me many lessons, particularly regarding the value of really brainstorming and planning a project, as well as my first experience with "scope creep".

## 🤔 The Problem

As described above, the desire is to "virtualize" the classic schoolyard arguments - "Uh uh, Spider-Man would _totally_ beat Batman in a fight!"

## 🧐 The Solution

The wonderful [Superhero API](https://superheroapi.com/) provides numeric, quantifiable statistics regarding the abilities of a superhero _(or villain)_. Using these characteristics, we can determine a "winner" between the two combatants.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Value of Wireframes and initial planning.

  > I'll cut myself a bit of slack on this one. At the outset, I had no intention of any functionality aside fom a mere superhero search.
